# Do While Loop

This is another type of loop in C#. It is similar to the while loop - but - the condition is checked at the end of the loop (not at the beginning). This means that your loop will guaranteed iterate at least once - even if the condition is false 

 Pseudo code: 

```text
x = 0; 									// Clearly, x is NOT greater than 10
do 
{ 
	/// bl bla bla bla 		// but this code will be executed at least ONCE
	// bla bla bla 				// before the condition is checked!
} while (x > 10); 			// restarts the loop if true

```

 **Formal syntax in Csharp** 

```csharp 
int yourchoice; 
// yourchoice is undefined, it better be defined before you hit the 
// checking of the condition 

do 
{ 
	// your code block 
	// It is your job to ensure thatâ€¯ 
	// yourchoice has a value (it is defined) 
	// Perhaps ask the user for input, and put that into yourchoice 
} while (yourchoice !=5); 

```

Compare and contrast of `while` versus `do while`: 

```csharp
while (x<10) { 						// NO SEMICOLON !!!
  // bla bla bla bl 
  // more code here 
}
```



```csharp
do { 
  // bla lba bla 
  // code here 
) while (x<10); 					// USE SEMICOLON !!!
```

## Creating Menus

This type of loop is excellent for menu choices and creating menus. 

Consider the pseudo code below: 

```text
int menuChoice
do
{
	clear screen
	print "Main Menu"
	print "1. option one"
	print "2. option two"
	... etc ...
	print "9. Quit Menu"
	
	print "please enter choice"
	input menuChoice
	if (menuChoice == 1) {
		do option one code
	}
	else if (menuChoice == 2) {
		do option two code
	}
	... etc
}
// QUIT
while (menuChoice !=9);
```

Notice how this menu system will keep looping offering the user choices and doing the choices until the user chooses 9, when the menu system stops. 

## Validating User Input

Sometimes we ask the user for input within a certain range - and we want the user to enter such a number. If they don't we want to keep asking them to do so until they type the proper number. 

**Remember:** *A `do-while loop` checks the `condition` AFTER the code block has been executed!*

**Example**

```csharp
int yourNumber;

// =======================================================================
// get valid user number using a do-while
// =======================================================================
// get the number
do
{
  Console.Write("Please enter a number between 9 and 49 inclusive: ");
  // NEVER DEFINE A VARIABLE INSIDE A LOOP
  // (the reason will be explained at a later date)
  // int yourNumber  !!! Don't do it!!
  yourNumber = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); 
}

// validation that number is good
while (yourNumber < 9 || yourNumber > 49);

// =====================================================================
// now that we have a valid user number... do stuff
// =====================================================================
Console.WriteLine("Yes, you have typed in a valid number: "+yourNumber);

// =====================================================================
// keep the console window open until the user hits "return" key
// =====================================================================
Console.ReadLine();
```



Consider displaying nice error messages for the user 

```csharp
int yourNumber;
int MIN_NUM = 9;
int MAX_NUM = 49

// =======================================================================
// get valid user number using a do-while
// =======================================================================
// get the number
do
{
  Console.Write("Enter a number between "+MIN_NUM+" and "+MAX_NUM+" inclusive: ");
  yourNumber = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); 
  
  // error message
  if (yourNumber < MIN_NUM || yourNumber > MAX_NUM) {
    Console.WriteLine("Please read instructions carefully!!!")
  }
}

// validation that number is good
while (yourNumber < MIN_NUM || yourNumber > MAX_NUM);

// =====================================================================
// now that we have a valid user number... do stuff
// =====================================================================
Console.WriteLine("Yes, you have typed in a valid number: "+yourNumber);

// =====================================================================
// keep the console window open until the user hits "return" key
// =====================================================================
Console.ReadLine();
```

# Debugging

Review Debugging Section from day 6

For the following exercise, use either `print` style debugging, or use the Visual Studio IDE debugger.

Note: how to set a breakpoint

> To set a breakpoint in source code, click in the far left margin next to a line of code. You can also select the line and press **F9**, select **Debug** > **Toggle Breakpoint**, or right-click and select **Breakpoint** > **Insert breakpoint**. The breakpoint appears as a red dot in the left margin.

What line(s) of code can have breakpoints?

> You can set a breakpoint on any line of executable code. For example, in the following C# code, you could set a breakpoint on the line of code with the variable assignment (`int testInt = 1`), the `for` loop, or any code inside the `for` loop. You can't set a breakpoint on method signatures, declarations for a namespace or class, or variable declarations if there's no assignment and no getter/setter.

## Class Exercise

Welcome to your job. 

Here are your instructions: 

> Step 1: 
>
> Step 2: 
>
> Step 3: 

What?  Well your boss isn't going to fill this out for you.  

This is what your boss will say:

>The program below is supposed to work. It doesn't. You're the big shot with "Concordia Software Engineering Degree" - you fix it. You tell me why it doesn't work. 

 ```csharp
 /* Example user types in 5 
 * you should see 2 4 6 8 10 
 * ... but you don't. Debug this and tell me why. 
 */ 
 Int32 userinput, i, xvalue; 
 Console.Write("enter a number"); 
 userinput = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); 
  
 for (i = 1; i <= userinput; i++) 
 { 
 		xvalue = i * 2; 
 		Console.Write(xvalue + ' '); 
 } 
 Console.ReadLine(); 
 ```

The answer to this question will be told orally to you during the class. You have to have tried this and figured out "something" yourself first. This is why I'm not writing the answer here. You have to listen and compare it to what you've done.  

If you haven't done the above or at least tried it: NO UBISOFT FOR YOU!
