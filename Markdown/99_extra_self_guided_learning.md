## Asynchronous Programming

> If you must venture into Asynchronous programming, I suggest the following:
> - Stick to [System.Timers.Timer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.timers.timer) for now, it's simpler and safer.
> - Avoid returning values from a function running on a separate thread back to your main function.
