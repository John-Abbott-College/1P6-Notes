# Day 2 - Computational Thinking
*August 25th, 2022*

This course has 3 main learning objectives:

1. Learn basic syntax of the C# programming language.
2. How to isolate, identify and debug program errors.
3. Improve logic and Computational Thinking (CT).

Most people focus on the first point, however, like any spoken and written language, it will easily come with a little bit of theory and **a lot of repetition**. You will learn multiple languages over your coding journey.

The last two points are **the most important skills of a computer programmer**. That's where my teaching style will focus.


## The "What" - Elements of CT

> **Computational Thinking** (CT) is the thought process involved in formulating a problem and expressing it's solution(s) in such a way that a computer - human or machine - can effectively execute it..."
> - Jeannette Wing

In other words, it is **an approach to problem solving** that involves 4 main elements:

- **Decomposition**: taking a complex problem and breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts (easier to understand, conceive, and maintain).
- **Pattern recognition**: observing patterns, trends, and comparing similarities and differences.
- **Abstraction**: generalizing instead of being specific. Finding general principles that create the patters by focusing only on the details that matter.
- **Algorithm Design**: develop simple step by step instructions that lead to a solution.


## The How: Practices of CT

The elements listed above are "high level" elements. To achieve them, one typically four practices:

- **Being incremental and iterative**: design should start with small pieces that can be verified to work. Slowly add complexity and regularly check that it is still functional.
- **Testing and debugging**: develop strategies for anticipating and dealing with problems efficiently. Most of the development time is spent debugging.
- **Reusing and remixing**: don't reinvent the wheel but understand what you are bringing into your design so that you can adapt it to your needs and fix it when it breaks. Provide proper attribution.
- **Abstracting and modularizing**: build something large by putting together collections of smaller parts. Make reusable and adaptable parts.
