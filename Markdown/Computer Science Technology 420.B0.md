**TEACHING METHODS** 

This course consists of 90 hours of scheduled lectures and lab work. In addition, each student will be required to do 45 hours of personal study that includes research, personally booked computer time and work at home. Léa, the course management system within Omnivox, will be used in this course. 

**DEPARTMENTAL LATE POLICY** 

All assignments and projects are expected to be submitted by the required due date. A late penalty of up to 10% per day might apply to assignments submitted late up to a maximum number of allowed late days. The exact percentage and the maximum will be indicated on the instructions specific to that assignment. Any work submitted after the maximum number of allowed late days has been reached will not be graded. 

**DEPARTMENTAL ATTENDANCE POLICY** 

Attendance is compulsory. Unexcused absences for more than 20% of the course's total hours will result in the student’s final grade being the mark accumulated up to that point. 

**COLLEGE POLICIES** 

Policy No. 7 – IPESA, Institutional Policy on the Evaluation of Student Achievement: 

http://johnabbott.qc.ca/ipesa 

 

- **Changes to Evaluation Plan in Course Outline** (Article 5.3) 

Changes to the evaluation plan, during the semester, requires unanimous consent. A major change also requires the department’s Chair and the program Dean’s approval. 

- **Religious Holidays** (Article 3.2) 

Students who wish to observe religious holidays must inform their teacher in writing within the first two weeks of the semester of their intent. 

- **Student Rights and Responsibilities**	(Article 3.2, item 18.) 

It is the responsibility of students to keep all assessed material returned to them in the event of a grade review. (The deadline for a Grade Review is 4 weeks after the start of the next regular semester.) 

- **Student Rights and Responsibilities** (Article 3.3, item 6.) 

Students have the right to receive the results of evaluation, for regular day division courses, within two weeks. For evaluations at the end of the semester/course, the results must be given to the student by the grade submission deadline. *Where applicable*: for intensive courses (i.e.: intersession, abridged courses), timely feedback must be adjusted accordingly. 

- **Cheating and Plagiarism** (Article 9.1 & 9.2) 

Cheating and plagiarism are serious infractions against academic integrity which is highly valued at the College; they are unacceptable at John Abbott College. Students are expected to conduct themselves accordingly and must be responsible for all of their actions. 

 

**Cheating** 

Cheating means any dishonest or deceptive practice relative to examinations, tests, quizzes, lab assignments, research papers or other forms of evaluation tasks. Cheating includes, but is not restricted to, making use of or being in possession of, unauthorized material or devices and/or obtaining or providing unauthorized assistance in writing examinations, papers or any other evaluation task and submitting the same work in more than one course without the teacher’s permission. It is incumbent upon the Department through the teacher to ensure students are forewarned about unauthorized material, devices or practices that are not permitted. 

 

**Plagiarism** 

Plagiarism is a form of cheating. It includes the intentional copying or paraphrasing (expressing the ideas of someone else in one’s own words), of another person's work or the use of another person’s work or ideas without acknowledgement of its source. Plagiarism can be from any source including books, magazines, electronic or photographic media or another student's paper or work.Page Break 

 

**Provisos** 

 

Attendance: Due to the COVID-19 health crisis, attendance policies may need to be adjusted by your teacher. The normal attendance expectations are outlined below and your teacher will inform you of any modifications as needed. Please note that attendance continues to be extremely important for your learning, but your teacher may need to define it in different terms based on the way your course is delivered during the semester. 

 

Please note that course outlines may be modified if health authorities change the access allowed on-site. This includes the possibility of changing to an entirely on-site or online format. 

In addition to LEA, Teams and Moodle, additional software may be used for the submission of essays or projects or for testing. Further details will be provided if applicable. 

 

Classes on Teams may be recorded by your teacher and subsequently posted on Teams to help for study purposes only. If you do not wish to be part of the recording, please let your teacher know that you wish to not make use of your camera, microphone or chat during recorded segments. Any material produced as part of this course, including, but not limited to, any pre-recorded or live video is protected by copyright, intellectual property rights and image rights, regardless of the medium used.
