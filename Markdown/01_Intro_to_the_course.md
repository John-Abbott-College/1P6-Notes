- You can contact me (Sandy Bultena) any way any time through email and/or MIO 

- Every course must give you a course outline. Save a copy of it!!!! For potential future reference at another institution. 
- The course outline for this class has been uploaded to LEA
- Evaluation plan cannot be changed - except for the number of assignments….. 
- The three tests – hopefully all on campus 
- Get a calendar of some sort - electronic. Put all your assignment due dates into it (Google / iOS / ? ) 
- Synchronize everything online - contacts info etc 
- Set a notification in MIO to buzz you! I mean send yourself an email that will buzz your phone so you get notified that a teacher or other has sent you info 
- Use MIO when handing things in that are flakey...ex… under a door etc….send a copy via MIO to protect yourself.
